# Adilson's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## ⚠️ Warnings

The configs contained here and this repo are yet in a state of **wip**.
**BE CAREFUL**, using this configuration MAY replace your actual config files.
This setup is designed for Hyprland configuration. 

##  Prerequisites

**chezmoi:** This is the primary tool used to manage and apply these dotfiles. You need to install `chezmoi` *before* you can use it to apply the configuration.

**[dependencies](dependencies.txt):** those are the dependencies to make the configu work properly, though right now only featuring chezmoi itself is yet a work in progress. 

## Installation

To install this config follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure [dependencies](dependencies.txt) are installed.**

2.  **Run `chezmoi init --apply Adilson-Kina` To apply the configurations.**

3. **That's it!!!**

Kinda simple, no?
